=================

CloneCraft WebAPI implementation seed

This project implements the required API to create a CloneCraft bot.

My objectives for this repo include:
- Mess around with convention based inversion of control
- Create a clean, easy to understand architecture
- Reduce the required bootstrapping phase for bot implementors as much as possible
